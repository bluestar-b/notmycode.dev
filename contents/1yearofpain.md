Hi, Phapoom Saksri here, the founder of notmycode labs (which might soon be renamed to notmycode foundation). I may be a bit late to announce this, but I'm thrilled to share that **notmycode has officially turned 1 year old** 🎉!

## A Short History of notmycode.dev

On **December 18, 2023**, I was chatting with **@bluestar-b** about registering a new domain. She suggested the name **notmycode.dev**, and since it was available at the time, I decided to snag it right away! And just like that, notmycode was born.
